## ⚠️ Critical Reminders

### Must Do

✅ **Follow EXECUTION_PLAN.md daily** - It's your roadmap

✅ **Update TASK_TRACKER.md** - Track your progress

✅ **Capture evidence as you go** - Screenshots, logs, Wireshark captures

✅ **Make your protocol unique** - Avoid plagiarism flags

✅ **Start early** - 22 days goes by fast

### Must Not Do

❌ **Don't skip the design phase** (Days 1-3) - Good design = easier implementation

❌ **Don't wait to test** - Test each feature as you build

❌ **Don't commit sensitive data** - Use .gitignore

❌ **Don't copy from other groups** - Your protocol must be unique

❌ **Don't use pre-built E2EE libraries** - Implement yourself
