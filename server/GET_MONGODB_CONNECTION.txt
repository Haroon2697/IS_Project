STEP-BY-STEP: Get MongoDB Atlas Connection String

1. In MongoDB Atlas (where you are now):
   - Click the green "Connect" button next to "Cluster0"

2. Choose connection method:
   - Select "Drivers" (not "MongoDB Shell" or "MongoDB for VS Code")

3. Driver selection:
   - Driver: "Node.js"
   - Version: Latest (should be selected by default)
   - You'll see a connection string like:
     mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@cluster0.xxxxx.mongodb.net/?retryWrites=true&w=majority

4. IMPORTANT: Replace placeholders:
   - Replace <username> with your MongoDB Atlas username
   - Replace <password> with your MongoDB Atlas password
   - Add database name at the end:
     mongodb+srv://username:password@cluster0.xxxxx.mongodb.net/secure-messaging?retryWrites=true&w=majority

5. If you haven't created a database user:
   - Go to "Database Access" in left sidebar
   - Click "Add New Database User"
   - Choose "Password" authentication
   - Create username and password (SAVE THE PASSWORD!)
   - Set user privileges: "Atlas admin" or "Read and write to any database"
   - Click "Add User"

6. Network Access (IMPORTANT):
   - Go to "Network Access" in left sidebar
   - Click "Add IP Address"
   - Click "Allow Access from Anywhere" (for development)
   - OR add your current IP address
   - Click "Confirm"

7. Copy the final connection string and update .env file
